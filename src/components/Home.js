        Whether we love them or hate them, calculators are here to stay—gone are
        the days when we could tell students, “You won’t always have a
        calculator.” We have to rethink what it means to teach kids how to do
        basic math in the calculator age. I’ve spent years figuring out how to
        incorporate calculators into my teaching in ways that teach my middle
        school students important skills like number sense, estimation, and
        problem-solving. Through trial and error, I have created and taught
        lessons that integrate calculators as a central tool in developing
        students’ mathematical curiosity, conceptual understanding, and
        procedural fluency. Two of my favorite lessons cover what many consider
        basic middle school concepts: percentages and fraction operations.
